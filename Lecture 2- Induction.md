Important propositions are called **theorems**.

# Sets

$S \subseteq T$ indicates that set S is a subset of set T and S may be equal to T.
$S \subset T$ indicates that set S is a subset of set.

$\overline A$ is consists from every element not in set A.Henceforth that is called **complement**
### Cardinality

|{1,2,3}| = 3
### Power set

Every subset of a set A.
### Cross product

A product of sets, S1 S2 , is a new set consisting of all sequences where the first component is drawn from S1, the second from S2, and so forth.

$\mathbb{N}\, \times \,\set{a,b} = \set{0,a}, \set{0,b}, \set{1,a}, \set{1, b} ...$
